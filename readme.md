### Building assets

### Developing an Engine

## Application flow

The main Java code is split up in two parts:
- javainterface: handles everything the game engine needs to do to start, run and finish.
- tictactoe: contains project specific code and extends most of javainterfaces abstract classes.

The Engine's entry point is the `src/java/io/riddles/gameengine/Go.java` file. This file creates a Go Engine and invokes it's run function.

### Testing

Tests are located in:
test/groovy/io/riddles/javainterface

For testing, the Groovy language is used, which is compatible with JDK 8. When you run 'gradle test', all tests located in /test are executed and results are shown.
